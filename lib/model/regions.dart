    regionDetails:
        "Kanto is the first region in the Pokémon universe and in the popular series, games and anime. It was then followed by Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova, Kalos, Alola, and Galar. It is modeled and named after the Kantō region of Japan, which includes, amongst other cities, the capital Tōkyō, where Game Freak is headquartered. Kanto is the only one that shares its name with a real-world location. The resemblance between the bay formations seen on the in-game map and the actual Sagami Bay, Suruga Bay, and Tokyo Bay formations is particularly striking. Kanto also has some elements of Chūbu.\n\nKanto lies to the east of Johto; they presumably make up a small continent; to the south of Kanto are the Sevii and Orange Islands. Hoenn, introduced in Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald, is supposedly further to the southwest. Routes located wholly within Kanto are numbered 1 to 25; routes 26, 27, and 28 connect Kanto with Johto. Supposedly to the north of this continent is the Sinnoh region. Unova is in a considerable distance away and it's unknown where both it and Kalos are in relation to Kanto.\n\nIn the first generation of games, Pokémon Red, Blue, and Yellow, Kanto was the only region to explore, featuring a variety of environments, such as urban locales and mountainous, wooded and oceanic routes. In Gold, Silver and Crystal, which introduced Johto, the player character character was able to travel to Kanto (by either steamboat, surfing or the magnet train) travelling between Goldenrod City in Johto and Saffron City in Kanto after completing their journeys through Johto. Since these games occupied an in-universe timeline a few years after their predecessors, some changes were introduced. In late 2004, Pokémon Red, Pokémon Green, and Pokémon Blue were remade as new titles for the Game Boy Advance called Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, which incorporated new elements. In late 2018, Pokémon Yellow was remade as two new games for the Nintendo Switch called Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!.\n\nTwo areas of the Kanto region, Saffron City and the Pokémon Stadium, are playable in HAL Laboratory's popular Super Smash Bros. fighting games. In the Nintendo 64 version, Saffron City is a cityscape battlefield while the Pokémon Stadium is a basic arena and transforms to water, grass, rock and fire type battlefields in Super Smash Bros. Melee. With the release of Super Smash Bros. Brawl comes a new Pokémon Stadium 2 to play on.\n\nIn the anime, the protagonist Ash Ketchum is a resident of Pallet Town, and began his journey by touring Pokémon gyms in Kanto with Misty from Cerulean City and Brock from Pewter City. Season 1 and Season 9 of the anime are set in Kanto. Location names in the anime sometimes differ from those in the games. Season 23 and 24 of the anime is also the set in Kanto as Ash and his new friend Goh from Vermilion City work as research assistants.",

        "Viridian Forest\nViridian Forest (トキワのもり Tokiwa no Mori) is a forest that lies between Viridian City and Pewter City. The woods are filled with a large quantity of Bug Pokémon and Bug-using Trainers. Inside, the Pokémon franchise's mascot, Pikachu, can be found. In Gold, Silver, and Crystal, the forest has been cut down and the tall grass removed, so wild Pokémon cannot be caught there anymore. In HeartGold and SoulSilver, Viridian Forest made a return.\n\nMt. Moon\nMt. Moon (オツキミやま Otsukimi-yama) is a mountain that lies between Pewter City and Cerulean City. As it cannot be climbed, player characters must hike through the cave area. It is a three-floor dungeon with multiple paths. At the end of the path, a Super Nerd holds two fossils. After the player character defeats him, he concedes and lets the player character take one fossil, which can become either Omanyte or Kabuto. In the Anime, it is shown as a worship place for Clefairy.\n\nCerulean Cave\nNear the city is the Cerulean Cave (ハナダのどうくつ Hanada no Dōkutsu), popularly known as the \"Unknown Dungeon\" (ななしのどうくつ Nanashi no Dōkutsu). It is an optional dungeon filled with high-leveled Pokémon and is the home to the strongest legendary Pokémon in Kanto, Mewtwo. The dungeon is so fearsome that a guard blocks the entrance, and will not let the player character through until he or she has beaten the Elite Four. In FireRed and LeafGreen, it cannot be accessed until the player character has repaired the machine on One Island.\n\nRock Tunnel\nRock Tunnel (イワヤマトンネル Iwa Yama Tonneru) lit. \"rock mountain tunnel\" is a pitch-black cave that connects Cerulean City and Lavender Town. Unlike later games, the cave is not completely dark.

Its entrances are south of Pewter City and east of Vermilion City. After the Trainer enters Cerulean City, the only foot-path back to Pewter City, Viridian City, and Pallet Town is through this cave. Wild Diglett and Dugtrio can be found in here.\n\nForest of Pikachu\nForest of Pikachu was a small forest clearing that had clans of Pikachu. It was only in the anime. The main protagonist Ash Ketchum and the group came here as they find other Pikachu in their adventure.

For a small fee, the player characters are given thirty Safari Balls (a special type of Poké Ball that is green) and may capture Pokémon in the Safari Zone until they have walked 500 steps. player characters may not use Pokémon of their own to battle the wild Pokémon in the Safari Zone. Several species of Pokémon are found nowhere else. In Gold, Silver, and Crystal, the Safari Zone is not available because Baoba is on vacation. It reappears in FireRed and LeafGreen, the option to save while there is removed; this could have been because of the Glitch City bug.\n\nSeafoam Islands\nThe Seafoam Islands (ふたごじま Futago-jima) are a set of caves between Fuchsia City and Cinnabar Island. The legendary Pokémon Articuno resides in this area. During the second generation, as Cinnabar Island was destroyed by a volcano, Blaine moved his gym to the Seafoam Islands. Articuno has fled. In HeartGold and SoulSilver, Seafoam Islands return and Articuno returns.\n\nPower Plant\nThe Power Plant (むじんはつでんしょ Mujin Hatsudensho) lit. \"unmanned power plant\" is an abandoned building found at the end of a waterway just before the entrance to Rock Tunnel. At the end of the building is the legendary Pokémon Zapdos. In Gold, Silver, and Crystal, the Power Plant has been reactivated and is used to run the Magnet Train. Zapdos is no longer there.\n\nVictory Road\nThe Kanto Victory Road (チャンピオンロード Chanpion Rōdo) is a cave that holds the only way to the Indigo Plateau, accessed to the west and north of Viridian City. The protagonist must have all eight badges to enter. Victory Road contains many high-level Pokémon, including the legendary Pokémon Moltres in the original Red and Blue versions of Pokémon. However, in the FireRed and LeafGreen remakes, Moltres has been moved to the Mt. Ember on the Sevii Islands.\n\nIndigo Plateau\nThe Indigo Plateau (セキエイこうげん Sekiei Kōgen) is the headquarters of the Pokémon League, located in northwest Kanto. In order to reach Indigo Plateau, Trainers must collect all eight Gym Badges of Kanto or Johto and pass through Victory Road, a cave located at the foot of the Plateau.",

        "Johto is a region connected to the western part of Kanto. It was introduced in Generation II, Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Pokémon Crystal, later seen in their remakes, HeartGold and SoulSilver. The third, fourth, and fifth seasons of the anime were also set there. In the games, all its cities either have plant-themed or color-themed names. Johto is mainly based on the Kansai region of Japan, with some elements of Chūbu and Shikoku. There are old-fashioned cities reminiscent of Nara and Kyoto and a modern commercial city reminiscent of Osaka. Some inhabitants speak the Kansai dialect in the Japanese releases of the game.\n\nThe mythology surrounding the Johto region features Ho-Oh, the Rainbow Pokémon guardian of the skies, and Lugia, the Diving Pokémon guardian of the seas, who previously perched on the Bell and Brass Towers respectively in Ecruteak City. When the Brass Tower burned down in a storm, Lugia flew away, and three Pokémon died in the process. Ho-Oh revived these Pokémon, creating Raikou, Entei and Suicune. Lugia's home, the Whirl Islands, were also created when the Pokémon dispelled a war over a singular island, splitting it into four islands and making them its home, producing powerful whirlpools to protect itself. Celebi, the Time Travel Pokémon, also calls Johto its home, residing in the Ilex Forest where it brings Pokémon and Trainers forward and back in time.\n\n100 previously unknown Pokémon reside in Johto. In the Generation II games, the player character's hometown is New Bark Town, where they can choose either Chikorita, a grass type, Cyndaquil,a fire type or Totodile, a water type as his/her first Pokémon.\n\nIn anime, Johto is the home region of Jimmy and his friends.",

In Ruby and Sapphire, the Normal Rank Contest Hall is here. In Emerald, it is replaced by a Battle Tent, a test to see how loyal your Pokémon are. The prize is a Nest Ball, obtainable only in Verdanturf Town.\n\nFallarbor Town\nFallarbor Town (ハジツゲタウン Hajitsuge Taun) lies north of Mt. Chimney. Most of its inhabitants work in agriculture; the soil is very fertile because of its high content of volcanic ash. In Ruby and Sapphire, the town is home to the Super Rank Pokémon Contest Hall. In Emerald, it is replaced by the Battle Tent.\n\nLavaridge Town\nLavaridge Town (フエンタウン Fuen Taun) is located at the foothills of Mt. Chimney. The Lavaridge Pokémon Center is connected to a hot spring, which is what Lavaridge Town is famous for all over the Hoenn region.

If the player character follows the plot, his or her first visit to Sootopolis City is during the time the weather in Hoenn has been disrupted by Groudon (Ruby), Kyogre (Sapphire), or both (Emerald). Player characters can head to Sootopolis City at an earlier time as long as they have received the Dive HM and Mossdeep Gym badge. Sootopolis City is the home of the last gym that can be challenged by the player character, whose leader is Wallace in Ruby, Sapphire, Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire, and Juan in Emerald, both of whom specialize in Water types.\n\nPacifidlog Town\nPacifidlog Town (キナギタウン Kinagi Taun) is an isolated settlement in the south of Hoenn. The entire town is said to have been built on top of a colony of Corsola.

        "Petalburg Woods\nPetalburg Woods is a Hoenn forest. This is the only place to catch Slakoth. A Team Aqua or Team Magma grunt with a Level 9 Poochyena attacks a person working for Devon Corporation here. In Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire in a cut scene you can see Zinnia.\n\nDevon Corporation\nThe Devon Corporation is very similar to Silph Co. from Kanto and is the Hoenn equivalent. It is also rumored to run the Pokémarts in Hoenn. Devon Corp. is owned by Mr. Stone, and it plays an important role in the games, allowing the player character to receive certain important items and revive fossils into Pokémon. The Devon Corp. headquarters are the target for robbery by Team Aqua and Team Magma. After the player character stops their crimes, Mr. Stone will ask the player character to deliver a letter to his son Steven Stone, and a Package to Captain Stern, in Slateport City. He will reward the player character with his or her PokéNav.The player character can also revive fossils here.\n\nRusturf Tunnel\nThe Rusturf Tunnel is a tunnel between Rustboro City and Verdanturf Town. Its name is a portmanteau of the first and last parts of the two cities that the tunnel joins. In the video games, construction has stopped because of concerns over disturbing the Whismur in the cave. Once the player character has the HM Rock Smash, he or she can break a rock to open the tunnel up and get the HM Strength.\n\nGranite Cave\nThe Granite Cave is an area to the Northwest of Dewford Town. In the video games, a hiker at the entrance will give the HM Flash to the player character, which can be used to increase vision in the pitch-dark basement (similar to the Rock Tunnel in the Kanto region). The player character must go through the cave to deliver a letter to a man named Steven Stone. It is the only place in the games where player characters may obtain Nosepass.\n\nMeteor Falls\nThe Meteor Falls is a waterfall-filled cave located near Fallarbor Town. Lunatone can be found here in Sapphire Version and Solrock can be found here in Ruby and Emerald.\n\nMt. Pyre\nMt. Pyre is a Pokémon graveyard, similar to Kanto's Pokémon Tower. It consists of two areas: the inside, a \"cave\" filled with Pokémon trainers that functions as a graveyard, and the outer mountain, which can be reached by exiting from inside. Mt. Pyre is considered the counterpart of the Cave of Origin (the cave where life begins), as Mt. Pyre is \"the place where life ends\". Atop the mountain is an old couple who guard two orbs, the Red Orb, and Blue Orb. They are the grandparents of Phoebe of the Elite Four.\n\nCave of Origin\nThe Cave of Origin is located at the north end of Sootopolis City. It is guarded by Wallace /Juan of Sootopolis Gym and is said to be a cave where life begins. Its opposite landmark is Mt. Pyre, said to be the place where life ends. Residents of Sootopolis are not permitted to enter the Cave of Origin. The contents of the cave are different in each game: In Ruby and Sapphire, the player character finds Groudon or Kyogre, respectively, and must defeat or capture it to proceed. In Emerald, Wallace is inside the Cave of Origin and knows how to stop the scuffle between Kyogre and Groudon.\n\nHoenn Victory Road|Victory Road\nVictory Road (チャンピオンロード, Chanpion Rōdo, Champion Road in Japanese) is a large cave that leads to the Pokémon League. It holds many trainers aspiring to reach the Pokémon League. During some point in Victory Road, a boy named Wally will catch up to the player character and battle. The player character originally mentored Wally at the beginning of the game, and Wally has matured into a strong opponent. It is accessed from the southern portion of Ever Grande and requires Rock Smash, Strength, and Waterfall to traverse. Since most of the cave is dark, it is harder to explore without the use of Flash.\n\nSky Pillar\nThe Sky Pillar is an abandoned tower to the north-east of Pacifidlog Town that is home to very strong Pokémon. Though an optional dungeon in Ruby and Sapphire, it plays a major role in Emerald; the player character needs to go to Sky Pillar to summon Rayquaza to solve the fight between Kyogre and Groudon in Sootopolis City. When the player character reaches the top of Sky Pillar (in Emerald, the second visit), Rayquaza can be fought and captured.\n\nBattle Tower/Battle Frontier\nIn Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, the Battle Tower (バトルタワー Batoru Tawā) is located on a small island. Its motto is \"Win it all and be the best, Trainers!\" To access the facility, the player character must first defeat the Elite Four, then receive the S.S. Tidal Ticket from the protagonist's father, Norman. After journeying on the newly completed ship, the player character will gain the option to visit the Battle Tower.\n\nSouthern Island\nThe Southern Island can only be unlocked using the Eon Ticket, which can only be obtained in the game from a special event, or by mixing records with someone who has the Ticket. Southern Island is located, as the name suggests, in the south of the region, just west of the Battle Frontier. One cannot Surf to get to the island; instead, they must board the ferry at Lilycove City with an Eon Ticket to get there. The island only exists to enable the player character to get both Latias and Latios.",

        "Sinnoh is the fourth region of the Pokémon Series and is the setting of the Nintendo DS games Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, as well as their Nintendo Switch remakes Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, and the prequel game Legends: Arceus, where it was known as Hisui during ancient time. It is also the setting of the Diamond and Pearl series of the anime.\n\nLike the previous regions in the previous games, Sinnoh features a broad range of environments for the player character to explore. The region is mountainous and temperate; for the first time in a Pokémon RPG, it features snowy routes. While this region's location with relation to other regions portrayed in the franchise is unknown, Ash Ketchum refers to Sinnoh as an island during the English dub of the last episode of season 9 of the anime, while Professor Oak mentions that it's located to the north of the Kanto/Johto landmass. The in-game map shows that the region consists of about 70% land and 30% water. There are thirty routes in Sinnoh numbered 201 to 230 and, like the Hoenn region before it, do not follow sequentially from the previous region's routes: routes in Hoenn, the previous region, were numbered 101 to 134.\n\nSinnoh has four lakes, each of which houses a legendary Pokémon: Lake Acuity houses Uxie, Lake Valor houses Azelf, Lake Verity houses Mesprit, and the secret Sendoff Spring houses Giratina inside Turnback Cave. Sinnoh is based on the geography of the Japanese island of Hokkaidō, the southern tip of the island of Sakhalin and the disputed island of Kunashir (Kunashiri).\n\nSinnoh features an extensive underground area called \"The Underground\". In this area, a player character can dig for stones, items and spheres, which can be exchanged for items with underground barterers. This is also the places that you can find fossils instead of obtaining one and not being able to collect the other such as in Pokémon Emerald Version. The player character can also use DS Wireless Communication compete with player characters within the area to a game of 'Capture the Flag'.",
